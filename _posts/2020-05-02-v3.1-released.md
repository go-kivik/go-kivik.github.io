Today, Kivik 3.1.0 is finally tagged and released.  This release adds two major
features, and punts on a third:

1. Partitioned queries, as introduced with [CouchDB 3.0](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/whatsnew/3.0.html) are now possible.

    This did require a small breaking change, as `Find()`, `Explain()`,
    `CreateIndex()`, `GetIndexes()`, and `DeleteIndex()` now take optional
    (variadic) options. For normal usage, no change is necessary, but if you've
    defined an interface with these methods, or otherwise depend on the exact
    function signature, your code may need to be updated to use this new
    version.

2. Kivik and the CouchDB driver now support sending [multiple queries to a view
with a single request](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/ddoc/views.html#sending-multiple-queries-to-a-view).
Although this feature has existed in some form or another for ages (since at
least version 1.7--the oldest I tested), I had never added support to Kivik.

And finally, I have decided to punt on one additional major feature added to
CouchDB 3.0: [full text search](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/ddocs/search.html).
The reason this isn't covered in this release is simply that I don't have a
convenient way to test it. The official distribution cannot be deployed in a
simple Docker container, so setting up a local test environment would be
non-trivial, and automated testing would be very difficult.

Having said that, I would welcome a pull request, if you have the means to add
and test this functionality.

The packages affected by this update:

- **kivik** -- [v3.1.0](https://github.com/go-kivik/kivik/releases/tag/v3.1.0)
- **couchdb** - [v3.1.0](https://github.com/go-kivik/couchdb/releases/tag/v3.1.0)
- **kivikmock** - [v3.1.0](https://github.com/go-kivik/kivikmock/releases/tag/v3.1.0)
- **kiviktest** - [v3.1.0](https://github.com/go-kivik/kiviktest/releases/tag/v3.1.0)

The `pouchdb` driver is unaffected by these changes, and remains at v3.0.x for
now.
