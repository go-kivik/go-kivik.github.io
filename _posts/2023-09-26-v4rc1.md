I'm happy to announce a new major release of Kivik is on the way.  [v4.0.0-rc1](https://github.com/go-kivik/kivik/releases/tag/4.0.0-rc1) has been released. Anyone interested is encouraged to test this release, and report any bugs before a final release is published, within a week or two.

This is a major release, and does represent a breaking change, and includes several improvements as well. Here is a brief overview of the main highlights:

- The multiple Kivik repositories have been integrated into the main repo
- Options are now functional options, rather than a plain `map[string]interface{}`
- The API for iterating over query results has been improved and made more consistent across various methods

See the [project README](https://github.com/go-kivik/kivik#changes-from-3x-to-4x) for a more complete list of breaking changes.
