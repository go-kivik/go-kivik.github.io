Today, Kivik 3.2.0 was tagged and released.  This release adds a single minor
feature: the `Membership()` method, which allows access to the `/_membership`
endpoint on CouchDB 2.x and newer.

I needed this for a project at work, where we need to programmatically query all
nodes in cluster.

I initially opted not to include this in Kivik, as it felt more like a
system-administration task, but my mind was changed when I needed it in
production.

The packages affected by this update:

- **kivik** - [v3.2.0](https://github.com/go-kivik/kivik/releases/tag/v3.2.0)
- **couchdb** - [v3.2.0](https://github.com/go-kivik/couchdb/releases/tag/v3.2.0)
- **kivikmock** - [v3.2.0](https://github.com/go-kivik/kivikmock/releases/tag/v3.2.0)
