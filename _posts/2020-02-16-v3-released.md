Today, Kivik 3.0.0 is finally tagged and stable, with only one minor bug fix since the final pre-release announced in December.

- **kivik** -- [v3.0.0](https://github.com/go-kivik/kivik/releases/tag/v3.0.0)
- **couchdb** - [v3.0.0](https://github.com/go-kivik/couchdb/releases/tag/v3.0.0)
- **pouchdb** -- [v3.0.0](https://github.com/go-kivik/pouchdb/releases/tag/v3.0.0)
- **kivikmock** - [v3.0.0](https://github.com/go-kivik/kivikmock/releases/tag/v3.0.0)
- **kiviktest** - [v3.0.0](https://github.com/go-kivik/kiviktest/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

Kivik v3.0.0 is functionally identical to v2.0.0. The only difference is that it has been configured to support Go modules. As such, Go 1.9 and 1.10 are no longer supported, as they do not support Go modules. See the [v2 release notes](http://kivik.io/v2-released) for a list of changes from v1.

For any projects compiled with GopherJS, the new dependence on Go modules means a little extra effort is needed.  I have detailed this in a brief tutorial on [Using GopherJS with Go Modules](https://jhall.io/posts/gopherjs-with-modules/).
