Today Kivik 2.0.0 is finally tagged and stable, with only one minor bug fix since the final pre-release announced in December.

- **kivik** -- [v2.0.0](https://github.com/go-kivik/kivik/releases/tag/v2.0.0)
- **couchdb** - [v2.0.0](https://github.com/go-kivik/couchdb/releases/tag/v2.0.0)
- **pouchdb** -- [v2.0.0](https://github.com/go-kivik/pouchdb/releases/tag/v2.0.0)
- **kivikmock** - [v2.0.0](https://github.com/go-kivik/kivikmock/releases/tag/v2.0.0)
- **kiviktest** - [v2.0.0](https://github.com/go-kivik/kiviktest/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

Kivik 3.0.0 should follow very shortly (within hours or days), and will be identical to Kivik 2.0.0, except that it will be configured for use with [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).
