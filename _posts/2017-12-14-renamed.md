Today `github.com/flimzy/kivik` became [`github.com/go-kivik/kivik`](http://github.com/go-kivik/kivik),
as [previously described](/preparing-for-rename).

From now on, to use Kivik 1.x, continue to use the old package name:

    go get github.com/flimzy/kivik

And...

<pre><code class="go">package main

import "context"
import "github.com/flimzy/kivik"
</code></pre>

To use Kivik 2.x, currently in early stage development, use the new package name:

    go get github.com/go-kivik/kivik

<pre><code class="go">package main

import "context"
import "github.com/go-kivik/kivik"
</code></pre>

Please report any problems by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/go-kivik/kivik/issues/new).
